Installation of procax25

This document explains how to compile and install the procax25 utility.

procax25 utilizes GNU Autotools (Autoconf, Automake), the standard build
system for many projects on Unix-like operating systems.

Prerequisites
-------------
To successfully compile this software, you need the following installed:
1. A C Compiler (GNU GCC is recommended).
2. GNU Make.
3. Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool utilities (required to generate the 
   configure script if installing from a Git repository).
4. The AX.25 development headers and libraries. The configure script
   will attempt to locate AX.25 dependencies in standard paths like
   /usr/local/lib and /usr/include.

Compilation and Installation Steps
----------------------------------

1. Generating the 'configure' script (If you obtained the source code 
   directly from a Git repository):

   If the 'configure' script is not present, you must generate it by 
   running the bootstrap sequence:

     $ ./bootstrap.sh  (or the sequence aclocal, autoconf, automake)

2. Configuration:

   Execute the 'configure' script to check your system environment and 
   generate the correct Makefile.

     $ ./configure

   Common configuration options:
   * To change the installation directory (default: /usr/local):
       $ ./configure --prefix=/your/path/
   * For help on all available options:
       $ ./configure --help

3. Compilation:

   Compile the program:

     $ make

4. Installation:

   Install the program and associated files into the configured system 
   directories. This step typically requires superuser privileges.

     $ sudo make install

5. Cleanup (Optional):

   To clean up the binary and object files after compilation:

     $ make clean

   To clean up all files generated by the configuration (including the
   Makefile and config.h), preparing the directory for a fresh build:

     $ make distclean

Common Issues
-------------
* "Package 'ax25-config' not found": If the configure script cannot find
    the AX.25 libraries, it will attempt to manually locate the files in
    common paths. If the error persists, ensure that the AX.25 libraries 
    and their development headers are properly installed.

* Permission issues: The 'make install' step often requires administrator
    privileges (use of 'sudo').
